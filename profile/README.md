## Java? Minecraft? What Could Go Wrong! 🙋‍♀️

Welcome to WabiSabiMC, where I document my inevitable descent into madness through Minecraft plugin development! This journey is inspired by the Japanese philosophy of Wabi-Sabi (侘寂) - or as I like to call it, "embracing the fact that my code will be a beautiful disaster."

I'm a Spanish-Cuban dev raised in Switzerland, which means I make code that's passionate, rhythmic, and arrives exactly on time... in theory. In reality, I'm a complete Java noob preparing for university by voluntarily subjecting myself to curly braces and semicolons.

## The Journey Begins (With Copious Amounts of Matcha)

This is day (03.03.2025) one of my "how hard could it be?" adventure. As a newcomer to Java and Minecraft plugin development, I expect challenges ahead - but that's exactly what wabi-sabi embraces. Each imperfect line of code, each bug, and each refactor is part of the natural growth process.

My current Java knowledge can be summarized as:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Help me (╥﹏╥)");
}
```

On a more serious note, my plan is to:
- Learn Java fundamentals through online resources and tutorials
- Start with simple plugins and gradually tackle more complex projects
- Document what I learn to help other beginners
- Build a portfolio of work that showcases my progress

## Current Status: Mostly Confused, But Determined

Right now I'm setting up:
- Git (because clearly I need to version-control my mistakes)
- SpigotMC account (where I'll eventually post plugins that don't crash... hopefully)
- An IDE that will witness my descent into Stack Overflow dependency
- The perfect playlist for debugging at 3 AM

My first commit message will probably be "IT'S ALIVE" followed quickly by "NEVER MIND IT'S DEAD AGAIN."

## Future Repositories 👩‍💻

- **hello-world-but-complicated** - Like Hello World, but with 47 unnecessary design patterns
- **WabiSabi-Template** - A starter template for new plugins
- **First-Plugin** - My first actual attempt at making something useful (results may vary)
- **Learning-Notes** - Documentation of what I learn, written by me, for me, and possibly for anyone who enjoys comedic tragedy

### Documentation and Resources

- As I learn, I'll add documentation to each repository (documentation status: "I'll document it later")
- I plan to create a wiki with my notes and discoveries
- Project ideas and plans will be tracked in the Projects section, alongside my diminishing sanity

## How to Follow Along 🌈

If you'd like to join me on this journey:

1. **Star** this repo (it's like applauding someone who's about to walk into a glass door)
2. Check back for new repositories as I create my first plugins
3. Feel free to offer beginner-friendly advice if you see ways I could improve
4. Share resources you found helpful when you were learning

While I'm not quite ready for major contributions yet, feedback and encouragement are always welcome! Especially if that encouragement comes in the form of "it gets better" (it does get better, right? ...right?)

## Fun Facts That Are Actually Just Cries For Help 🍿

- **Dev Fuel**: My coding sessions are powered by yerba mate and Swiss chocolate (the only way to survive)
- **Inspiration**: I love anime and Japanese aesthetics, which influenced my project name
- **Debugging Strategy**: Staring intensely at the screen while muttering "why?"
- **Cultural Approach**: Swiss precision meets Latin drama – perfect for coding crises

## Where To Find Me Having Existential Crises

- **SpigotMC**: [WabiSabiMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/wabisabimc.xxxxx/) (coming soon)
- **BuiltByBit**: [WabiSabiMC](https://builtbybit.com/members/wabisabimc.xxxxx/) (coming soon)
- **Polymart**: [WabiSabiMC](https://polymart.org/user/wabisabimc.xxxxx) (coming soon)
- **Discord**: Where I'll go to ask questions that make experienced developers question their career choices
